## Description

üéµ iPod : 1'000 songs in your pocket

-   üçè The first iPod, 100% designed in CSS _-except some icons-_

-   One of the most famous slogan : **1'000 songs in your pocket**

-   The basic features are available : `Play` / `Pause`, `Go to the next song` / `Go to the previous song`, `Go automatically to the next song`

-  I tried to be as much faithful as I can to the original.

-  I manually put 6 old songs in a `data.js`, in memory of the good old days

### Technologies
-   HTML
-   SCSS
-   React (using <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank">Vite.js</a>)

## Things I'd like to improve

-   I couldn't find out how I could handle with the sound when scrolling on mobile
